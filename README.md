### ROCm Library Files for gfx1031 and gfx1032 based AMD GPUs for use in Windows.

This repo was created to host ROCm Library files for use in the ZLUDA CUDA Wrapper for AMD GPUs  
Download `ROCmLibs.zip` and place them into `%HIP_PATH\bin\rocblas\` after renaming the libary folder there to something else (eg "oldlibrary").
